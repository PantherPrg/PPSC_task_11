# PPSC_task_11: Colored Cows
**| difficulty: 2/10 |**

Farmer Joe owns a pasture, where he tends his many, many cows. Unlike other farms, these cows feed on alien grass, making them change colors. Soon enough, Joe's cows are all a varying number of colors, and he wants to find out exactly what colors his cows are. Since it would be tedious to go through thousands of cows, he brings his highschool programmer skills back to life to automate this process. Return a string (in alphabetical order) of each color that is present in the given population.

Example population:
["purple", "orange", "mint", "orange", "orange", "red", "purple", "red", "orange", "mint", "purple", "purple]

Example result:
"mint
orange
purple
red"

Make sure to add a newline at the end of your answer for it to match the answer format.

**optional challenge: write your code in under 4 lines**

This problem introduces sets, strings, and list sorting. Pretty cool. **Do your research, google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. We would be able to go over them during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
